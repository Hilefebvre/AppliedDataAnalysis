# Abstract
In a time where ressources are diminishing and population is growing, the theme of sustainable development is naturally becoming central in topical issues. When we see the state of our planet it raises a lot of questions on our lack of interest on these issues and the difficulty to integrate them in the social most important matters. Our main goals are to understand how sustainable development related thematics are now interfering with topical society’s interests and how it is received by its people. Also, it is important to understand in which context we talk about those issues and how we talk about them. Do authorities and media like newspapers act in favor of giving a bigger place for this theme on the politics plate or not? In order to draw up an analysis on this trend, we are going to use the archives of the Gazette de Lausanne and the Journal de Genève that gather 200 years of journalistic work and have followed society main interests over the time.

# Research questions
- An interesting question is about trying to understand to what extent sustainable development related subjects are expanding in the news and when social authorities through newspaper media started to initiate a raise in people’s awareness of the way to deal with our ressources and the way we split it between all human population. - Another interesting fact is to see that it is a dividing subject between people who believe in taking good care of our planet to make it flourish and the ones who do not have this long term vision and are simply not affected by those matters. In that sense, it would be interesting to see in which context we are talking about these issues, i.e. when talking about ecology only or also when debating of education needs, economy and all these various aspects of our society. Is it done in a positive or negative way?- Wrongly, some people tend to picture a sustainable development activist as a what we used to call a « hippie ». What has lead people to think that? What is the media responsibility in it?

# Dataset
The dataset provided by Le Temps gathering 200 years of newspapers archives is a mine of information on society’s interests trends over the time. We want to explore it with our prism regarding sustainable development and provide an analysis on this topic’s vision and evolution over the time. When did we start to talk about sustainable development? It was certainly not mentioned in those terms at the time, what did set the stage to this matter? This dataset is wide and gives us the opportunity to explore a lot of data. First of all, we intend to focus on the last 100 years of archives because we consider that prior to that time, there is not much to find on these problematics in the newspaper. Le Temps archives website enables us to explore the data and research information by name entities. Indeed, when typing the term sustainable development, a graphic is displayed showing the occurrences of this term and not much is found in the 19th century. Secondly, we intend to focus on newspaper articles titles to explore the data. We think that titles reveals the spirit of an article enough to extract consistent information from it only. Also it will in a way, reduce our amount of data and make it easier for us to process and analyze it at first. 
At this stage of the project, we have not played around enough with the dataset to give more explanation on the way we are certain to analyze the data. For now, we have focused, as stated above, on delimiting the amount of data we want to consider of our analysis.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

Get the data of the 2 newspapers (Journal de Genève and Gazette de Lausanne), predecessors to Le Temps, and start exploring it using Pandas in an IPython notebook.

Play with SPARQL request from the website to get on-demand and precise data.
http://www.letempsarchives.ch/sparql

Fill the project repo with a notebook containing data collection and descriptive analysis, properly commented.

Update the notebook with a more structured and informed time plan for what comes next (till the presentation).


# Questions for TAs

- We saw that data are heavy, and available on the cluster. Do we need a VPN to access it ?
